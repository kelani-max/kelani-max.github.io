<h2> <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter Home </a> I am a 15 year old girl. I have 6 sisters and 2 brothers. In total there are 9 of us. I am an upcoming junior at Evergreen Valley Highschool. I love my siblings but they can tend to be very annoying. I love to cook, especially when my little brother wants to help me, but sometimes he always wants to play Roblox. The oldest of my siblings is my sister Stephanie and shes 31, the youngest is my sister melayah, shes 11. (oldest/youngest girls) I LOVE TURTLES !!!! i also love to shop but..... ion got no money:(
